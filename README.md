Version Control is a way to have many people working on the same project on different devices and at different times. Git is an example of version control. Everyone working has the Git program on their computeres and can all contribute to the project through their own specific versions. The version control program Git allows different contributors to add to the same project and have a timeline of what has been accomplished. The difference between Git and Github is that Git is the program that allows for colaberation and tracking project progress, and Github is the storage place where the most recent project version is kept.

Git status: a way to check what you have done on the version of the project you are working on
Git add: includes the changes made into the file save with git
Git commit -m "": this commits the changes done to the file to a preped file to be trasfered with a note on what was done
Git push: pushes the version that you have completed to the repository in Github or another repository service
